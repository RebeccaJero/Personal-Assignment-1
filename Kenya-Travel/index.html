                    <h2>Kenyan Language</h2>
                    <p>
                            Kenya is a multilingual country. Although the official languages are Swahili and English, there are actually a total of 62 languages spoken in the country (according to Ethnologue). 
                            These mainly consist of tribal African languages as well as a minority of Middle-Eastern and Asian languages spoken by descendants of foreign settlers (i.e. Arabic, Hindi, etc). 
                            The African languages come from three different language families - Bantu languages (spoken in the center and southeast), Nilotic languages (in the west), and Cushitic languages (in the northeast).

                            There are also the ‘Nilotic’ tribes such as the Luo, Kalenjin, Maasai and Turkana.
                            The ‘Hamitic’ people include the Turkana, Rendille and Samburu.
